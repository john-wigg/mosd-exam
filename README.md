# About

This repository contains project work done as an exam preparation for the course Management of Scientific Data at the FSU Jena.

In it, I work with the dataset "311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present", which is freely available here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9

The goal of this project is to work through a simple data lifecycle (Data Management Plan -> Data Quality Control -> Data Analysis and Presentation -> Perserving and Publishing) using the exemplary research question "What is the influence of national holidays on 311 service requests?". In order to keep the project withing scope, I chose to only do this for Independence Day 2019.

The project consists of a single Python Jupyter Notebook which is also available as a PDF version.
